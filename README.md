# OpenQ4

OpenQ4 is an open-source, drop-in engine replacement for Quake 4. It continues the Quake4Doom goal of a fully featured, fully functional engine replacement while modernizing the base with RBDOOM3.

**Goals**
- Provide a drop-in replacement engine for Quake 4 with compatibility for original game DLLs.
- Maintain feature parity for both single-player and multiplayer.
- Modernize rendering, audio, and platform support via the RBDOOM3 base.
- Keep documentation current as significant changes land.

**Rules**
- Always strive for binary compatibility with original Quake 4 game modules (DLLs).
- Preserve behavior expected by the Quake 4 SDK and shipped game data.
- Document significant changes for future maintainers.
- Keep credits accurate and up to date.
